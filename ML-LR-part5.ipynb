    "## Linear Regression Part 5: Vectorization and Matrix Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "We've covered a lot of fundamentals in the last 4 posts about Linear Regression and in this post we will cover another important idea, \"Vectorization\". In this context we will rewrite the equations for Linear Regression in matrix/vector form and derive the direct/exact solution to find the model parameters by solving a simple matrix equation. We will also generalize the linear regression problem to multiple feature variables, **Multi-Variate Linear Regression**. This is a natural extension from expressing the equations in matrix form.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the paragraph above I used the word **\"simple\"** in regard to the matrix equations. I should qualify that! **Everything is simple when you know how to do it!** This post is a bit more advanced than the previous posts since it is using some linear algebra. **[Linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linear_algebra)** is one of the important corner-stones of understanding machine learning, and actually, is a corner-stone of nearly all numerical computing.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic mathematics prerequisites for understanding Machine Learning are Calculus-I,II,III, Linear Algebra, and, Probability and Statistics. A computer science student that is interested in Machine Learning would be well advised to get a minor in Mathematics (or just get a degree in Mathematics instead!) You don't need to know these subjects at the level of a mathematician rather more like an engineer. This is especially true for linear algebra. Linear algebra is a great first course for a theorem proving course (real mathematics). What is needed for machine learning and a computer scientist is more like \"applied numerical linear algebra\".\n",
    "\n",
    ">You don't need to understand all of the math used in this post! The main take-aways are the finial equations and the \"idea\" of rewriting formulas in matrix vector form. You can think of vectors and matrices as \"programming data structures\" and then realize how they are used by libraries like numpy.    \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have much mathematics background don't be intimidated by the statements above! It's not that hard and you can learn a lot by just following along as best you can. I wont explain everything in detail but will try to give insight into what's going on.\n",

    "### Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and some Operations with them\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is very brief (and inadequate!) introduction to some of the structures and operations in linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scalar\n",
    "A scalar is just a single number. For example,\n",
    "$$ \\alpha = 2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vector\n",
    "A vector is a column array of scalars. It has 1 index ($a_1$ is the first element of $a$, -- or maybe that could be $a_0$!)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are scalars.\n",
    "#### Matrix\n",
    "A matrix is a 2 dimensional array. The following matrix has 2 rows and 2 columns. You can think of the columns as vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12}\\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix has 2 index values ($i,j$). The \"1,2 element\" of $A$ is $a_{12}$\"\n",
    "#### Dimensions\n",
    "We would say the the matrix $A$ is a \"2 by 2\" or $2 \\times 2$ matrix. In general it could be $n \\times m$ i.e. $n$ by $m$, where are $n$ and $m$ are scalars. The vector $a$ is \"a 2 vector\" i.e. has length 2. You could also think of it as a 2 by 1 matrix.\n",
    "#### Transpose\n",
    "The transpose of a vector or matrix has it's \"indices switched\". It is usuall written as a superscript $'$ or $T$. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a' = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A' =  \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21}\\\\ a_{12} & a_{22} \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements around the diagonal of $A$ are switched. In general $A' \\ne A$.\n",
    "#### Multiplication\n",
    "Scalars , vectors and matrices can be multiplied.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\alpha a' = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha a_1 & \\alpha a_2 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices and vectors are multiplied so that each element of the result is a \"row times column with the result summed\". The following vector product is also called a vector \"dot\" product\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a' b = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{1} & a_{2} \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} b_{1} \\\\ b_{2} \\end{bmatrix} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"1 by 2\" row vector $a$ times the \"2 by 1\" column vector $b$ is the \"1 by 1\" scalar $a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A B  = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21}\\\\ a_{12} & a_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "          \\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{21}\\\\ b_{12} & b_{22} \\end{bmatrix} =\n",
    "          \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21} & a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22} \\\\  a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21} & a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22} \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For matrices think \"row times column summed\" for each element of the result matrix.\n",
    "#### Operation Dimensions\n",
    "When you perform operations with vectors and matrices you need to keep their \"dimensions\" in mind. For conventional matrix multiplication **the inner dimensions must be conformable**. For example you can multiply a $1 \\times 2$ vector with a $2 \\times 3$ matrix and the result would be a $ 1 \\times 3$ dimensional vector. You can multiply a matrix or vector by a scalar element-wise and you can add a scalar to a matrix or vector element-wise. You can also add 2 vectors or matrices element-wise if they have the same dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to be careful when using matrices and vectors. It's always good to check your work by looking at the dimensions of all operations to be sure you haven't forgotten a transpose or something. A couple of other characteristics to be aware of is that matrix multiplication is not commutative, that is, in general $AB \\neq BA$ and the transpose or inverse of a product may not be what you think, $(AB)' = B'A'$ and $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not enough explanation! If you understand the above you are set, if not, then you might want to look at some of the [great Wikipedia pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linear_algebra).  \n"

    "We can consider $h(x)$ as a vector valued function of the complete column of $m$ numbers that are house sizes in our dataset i.e. $x$ is a vector of house sizes. We had also introduced $a$ as being a 2 vector containing the parameters $a_0, a_1$. So, without using any special change in notation we can think of $h$ as a vector function of $x$.\n",

We also need the gradient (or derivative) to find the \"matrix\" solution to the equations. **(I will do the derivation here but, this would be considered advanced even though it is a relatively easy problem ...

    "I hope the value of converting problems to matrix form is clear from this post. I feel it is much easier to work with matrix equations and it makes implementing efficient code straight forward. It's generally the case that having formulas in matrix form and using optimized mathematical libraries will give excellent performance. In anaconda Python numpy is compiled against Intel's excellent MKL (Math Kernel Library) this gives Python the potential for some of the performance capability of code built with lower level compiled compiled languages like C/C++ or Fortran.   \n",
