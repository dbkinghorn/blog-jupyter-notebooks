    "> **<rant-on>** **What's in a name?** \"*A rose by any other name would smell as sweet*\". In my opinion calling this \"Multinomial Logistic Regression\" stinks! A multinomial is a specific mathematical thing and I already used \"multinomial term expansion of feature sets\". I really feel that a more descriptive name would be \"Multi-Class\". ... but Multinomial Logistic Regression is the name that is commonly used.**<rant-off>**  \n",

The usage example will be image classification of hand written digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. \n",

    "\n",
    "You can think of logistic regression as if the logistic (sigmoid) function is a single \"neuron\" that returns the probability that some input sample is the \"thing\" that the neuron was trained to recognize. It is a binary classifier. It just gives the probability that the input it is looking at is the **ONE thing** that it was trained to recognize. To generalize this to several \"things\" (classes) we can create a collection of these binary \"neurons\" with one for each class of the things the we want to distinguish. You could think of that as a single layer network of these sigmoid neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "To classify the 10 digits 0-9 there would be 10 of these sigmoid neurons in a single layer network. Like this,\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig1](./logistic-net09-tikz.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The $f_i$ are the features i.e. pixels in an image, $h_i$ are the 10 individual digit models and MAX(P) is the result with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is basically what we are going to do. In general the steps are,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a 0,1 vector $y_k$ for each class $k$. Each $y_k$ will have a 1 matching the position of all samples in the training set that match that class and 0 otherwise. (I will put them in a matrix $Y$ where the $k^{th}$ column of $Y$ is $y_k$)\n",
    "- Do an optimization loop over all $k$ classes finding an optimal parameter vector $a_k$ to define $k$ models $h_k$\n",
    "- To test i.e. classify, an input evaluate it with each $h_k$ to get a probability that it is in class $k$.\n",
    "- Pick the class with the highest probability as the \"answer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically for the MNIST digits dataset being used; \n",
    "- There will be $k=10$ classes with labels {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.\n",
    "    - For a set with $m$ samples $Y_{set}$ will be an $(m \\times 10)$ matrix of 0's and 1's corresponding to samples in each class. For example the first column of $Y$ will have a 1 in each row that is a sample image of a \"0\". ... The tenth column of $Y$ will have a 1 in each row that is a sample of a \"9\".        \n",
    "- The full data set has 42000 samples which will be divided into \n",
    "   - 29400 training-set samples,\n",
    "   - 6300 validation-set samples,\n",
    "   - 6300 test-set samples. \n",
    "- The digit images in the MNIST dataset have 28 x 28 pixels. These pixels together with the bias term is the number of features. That means that each sample feature vector will have 784 + 1 = 785 features that we will need to find 785 parameters for.        \n",
    "- The optimization loop will be over the 10 classes and will produce a matrix $A$ of optimized parameters by minimizing a cost function for each for the 10 classes. Each column of the 10 columns $A$ will be a model parameter vector corresponding to each of the 10 classes (0-9).\n",
    "- To test or use the resulting model the input sample will be evaluated for each of the 10 \"class models\" and sorted by highest probability. The result with the highest probability is the prediction from the model.\n",

It is possible to work on each model separately to try to get better fits and the regularization term could be adjusted per model.
